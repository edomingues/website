#### JobRunr gets a __5/5 score for developer friendliness__ as it:
- comes out-of-the-box with a __web dashboard__ to present past, present and future jobs, along with execution statistics and management controls
- has great Spring Boot, Micronaut and Quarkus integration
- auto generates all SQL Tables / NoSQL data structures on first launch
- allows to start and schedule jobs in a __1-liner using nothing more than a Java 8 lambda__
